## Basic Unix Commands
<br>
`cd <directory name>`  
Change directory (e.g. cd pictures brings you to the sub-directory “pictures”)  

`cd ..`  
Change directory up one level to the parent directory  

`cd`   
Return to the home directory  

`chmod`  
Modifies the permissions on a file or directory  

`cp <current filename> <new file name>`  
Copy (e.g. cp cats1.jpg cats2.jpg makes a copy of the picture “cats1.jpg” and calls it “cats2.jpg”)  

`cp -i <current filename> <new file name>`  
Use cp -i to be prompted before over-writing another file. This is a safer method.

`ls`  
Lists a directory of your files  

`ls -l`  
Lists a directory with more information about the files  

`ls -a`  
Lists a directory including the hidden files  

`man`  
This is the online Unix help documentation (as in “manual”). Type man + the command (e.g. man ls) for a detailed explanation of the command. Type q to leave the manual pages.  

`mkdir <directory name>`  
Creates a new directory (e.g. mkdir pictures creates a directory called “pictures”)  

`pico`  
Use pico <filename> to edit a text file  

`pwd`  
See the current directory and path  

`rm <filename>`  
Remove (or delete) a file (e.g. rm cats1.jpg deletes the file “cats1.jpg”)  

`rmdir <directory name>`  
Removes an empty directory (e.g. rmdir pictures removes a directory called “pictures” as long as that directory is empty)  

`df -h <path>`  
On i6.cims.nyu.edu, use this command to check the amount of space you have left. For example, to check on a student’s folder or directory: df -h /home1/x/netid where x represents the first letter of your NetID and netid represents your directory on i6 and your netid (eg. “ab123”). For example, for user id “dd123”: df -h /home1/d/dd123.  

Note: Use the Control key + c to cancel what you’re currently doing. Use Control key + d to log out.
