# Ada Lovelace
# Intro to Programming
# Example of commented code

# defining my variables
score1 = 89
score2 = 70

# printing a string
print("Hello, world!")

# printing an integer
print(5)

# calculating the average of scores
score_avg = (score1 + score2)/2
print("Score avg: ", score_avg)


# commenting is good for organization as well
# --- Section Break --- #

item = "Bread"
price = 1.99

# Desired Output: 
# Item: Eggs Price: $1.99

# I want to print out the dollar sign in front
# of 1.99, but I need to get rid of spaces, so
# I changed sep to equal ""
# and then I added in the spaces manually
print("Item: ", item, " Price: $", price)
