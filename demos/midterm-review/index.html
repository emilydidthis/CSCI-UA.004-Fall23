            A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed
            between land-based stations to carry telecommunication signals
            across stretches of ocean. The first submarine communications
            cables—laid in the 1850s—carried telegraphy traffic. Subsequent
            generations of cables carried telephone traffic, then data
            communications traffic. Modern cables use optical fiber technology
            to carry digital data, which includes telephone, Internet, and
            private data traffic.

            Modern cables are typically about 25 millimeters (0.98 in) in
            diameter and weigh around 1.4 kilograms per meter (0.4 lb/ft) for
            the deep-sea sections, which comprise the majority of the run.
            Larger and heavier cables are used for shallow-water sections near
            shore. As of 2010, submarine cables link all the world’s continents
            except Antarctica.
