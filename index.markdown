## i6 Account
In addition to your NYU Home Account, we will be using a web hosting account on a Unix server which will be assigned to you automatically based on your enrollment. This is called an [“i6” account](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6) and we will use it to host our websites. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on this [FAQ page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq). If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to [this page](https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword) for instructions on how to do so.

## Computers and File Backup
As class time will include live coding and individual exercises, you are encouraged to bring a laptop computer. There are also multiple [student technology centers](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/teaching-and-learning-services/studios-and-computing-labs/student-technology-centers-computer-labs.html) on campus. Make sure to save copies of your projects and back them up to other media, such as an external drive or use a version control system like [GitHub](https://github.com/).
