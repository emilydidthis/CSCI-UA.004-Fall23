            <h1>Units of Measurement</h1>
            <h2>Introducing the Units</h2>
            <p>"px," "%," "em," and "rem" are all units of measurement used in web design and development to specify the size, position, and spacing of elements on a web page. These units are used to define the dimensions and layout of web content. Here's what each of them represents:</p>

        <section>
            <h2>px (pixels)</h2>
            <p>Pixels are a unit of measurement that represents the smallest, indivisible unit of a display screen. They are often used for specifying fixed and absolute dimensions, such as font sizes and border widths. Pixels provide a precise and consistent way to define the size of elements, but they don't easily adapt to different screen sizes or user preferences.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>% (percentages)</h2>
            <p>Percentages are used to specify dimensions in relation to the parent element or the viewport (the visible area of the browser window). They provide a flexible way to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. For example, setting an element's width to 50% means it will occupy half of the available width.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>em (Relative to Font Size)</h2>
            <p>The "em" unit is a relative unit of measurement, and it is based on the font size of the parent element. For example, if the font size of a parent element is 16px, setting an element's font size to 2em means it will be 32px (2 times the parent's font size). Em units are often used for text-related properties and scaling text proportionally.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>rem (Root em)</h2>
            <p>The "rem" unit is also a relative unit based on the font size, but it is relative to the root element (usually the <html> element). This makes it more predictable and easier to manage than "em." Rem units are commonly used for creating responsive layouts and scaling typography.</p>
