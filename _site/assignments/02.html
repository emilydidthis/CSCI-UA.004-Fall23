    <h2 id="html">HTML</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will create a three-page website about yourself. The focus at this stage of the development process is on describing web page content with HTML</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h3>
<p>Create a new directory (folder) on your computer called “me”. Place HTML and image files associated with your new website inside of this directory. The home page of your new website should be named “index.html”. Other pages can be named as you like, but should reflect the content of the page. Remember that all file and directory names should be limited to letters, numbers, and dashes and be lowercase, with no spaces.</p>

<p>When your website is finished, you will upload the “me” directory, along with its contents, to your i6 account. Your new website will then be available at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/me/</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="your-website">Your Website</h3>
<p>Three HTML web pages—about you—form the heart of the current assignment. Any combination of your background, interests, or experiences will do as long as it is autobiographical. You are to write these pages using a plain text editor such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. The focus of this assignment is on describing web page content with HTML; refrain from styling the pages until the next assignment, CSS.</p>

<p>Here is a list of required elements you should include in these pages.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There should be semantic text elements on each page, including but not limited to paragraph (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code>) and heading (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h2&gt;</code>, etc.) text.</li>
  <li>The pages should link to each other with “relative” URLs.</li>
  <li>Each page should also include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.</li>
  <li>You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, GIF, or SVG) on each page. (We’ve not covered image editing yet but feel free to use images from your camera or smartphone as well as images downloaded from the web.)</li>
  <li>All <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code> elements should include src, width, height, and alt attributes with appropriate values.</li>
  <li>You should include an HTML list somewhere on one of your pages; this can be an ordered, unordered, or description list.</li>
  <li>There should be semantic section elements on each page, including but not limited to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;header&gt;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;footer&gt;</code>.
Pay close attention to your HTML tags and be sure to test your pages locally in an up-to-date web browser as you code them. You can also check your HTML code using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="publishing-your-site">Publishing Your Site</h3>
<p>Upload your “me” directory, including the HTML and the image files, to the i6 Unix server with an SFTP client such as <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>, <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software.html">Fetch</a> or <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a>. Your files should go in the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“public_html”</code> directory that your assignments page is in, but within the subdirectory called “me”. Test your pages again in the browser once they are live on the web server to make sure they are accessible. Your new website should be available at: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/me/</code></p>

<p>Finally, create a link from the “HTML” line of your assignments directory to the home page of your new website.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting Your Assignment</h3>
<p>Submit the following via NYU Brightspace.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The URL to your pages in the general form of i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/</li>
  <li>A compressed archive containing all the files of your new website</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
