<p>In this assignment, you are to use CSS to style your assignments home page—from the <a href="http://localhost:4999/CSCI-UA.004-Fall23/assignments/01.html">Unix assignment</a> and original pages about you—from the <a href="http://localhost:4999/CSCI-UA.004-Fall23/assignments/02.html">HTML assignment</a>.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<p>Using a plain text editor, write CSS code for the web pages you’ve created for the first two assignments.</p>

<p>Here is a list of required elements to include for the <a href="http://localhost:4999/CSCI-UA.004-Fall23/assignments/01.html">assignments home page</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an internal style sheet (within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the document) with at least two different <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">CSS rule sets</a> (consisting of a selector and declaration block) for your assignments home page.</li>
  <li>Your assignments home page should also include two or more different inline style rules—as style attributes of HTML elements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a list of required elements to include for the website about <a href="http://localhost:4999/CSCI-UA.004-Fall23/assignments/02.html">you</a>.</p>

<p>Create one external style sheet (.css document) with at least six different <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp">CSS rule sets</a> and link it to all of your original HTML pages, about you.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your style rules should specify font family and font size for paragraph and heading text, and link states including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visited</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hover</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">active</code>.</li>
  <li>You should specify a background image and/or background color for your pages and style some other aspect of the CSS box model, such as border, margin, or padding.</li>
  <li>Create two or more class attributes somewhere in your HTML that are targeted and styled with CSS.</li>
  <li>Create an id attribute somewhere in your HTML that is targeted and styled with CSS.</li>
  <li>Use CSS flexbox to arrange items along one axis—such as menu bars, paragraphs of text, and/or images.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond these requirements, feel free to include additional CSS to design your pages as you like. Remember to test your pages locally in the web browser as you proceed.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="publishing-your-site">Publishing Your Site</h3>
<p>Upload your files (including the HTML, CSS, and image files) to the i6 Unix server with an FTP client. Test your files again in the web browser once they are live on the server to make sure they are accessible.</p>

<p>Finally, create a link from the “CSS” line of your assignments directory to the home page of your newly styled website. Note: These can be the same websites (and links) you submitted for the Unix and HTML assignments, with CSS added.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting Your Assignment</h3>
<p>Submit the following via <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/300438">NYU Brightspace</a>. More information on submitting files with NYU Brightspace is also available here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The URL to your website on i6</li>

Please note that you are required to submit files along with the URL in order to receive credit for your work.</li>
</ul>
