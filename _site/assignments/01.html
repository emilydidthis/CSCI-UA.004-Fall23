    <div class="assignment-page">
    <h2 id="unix">Unix</h2>
<p>In this assignment you will create a basic Web page and publish it on a Unix server at i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="account-information">Account Information</h3>
<p>In order to set up your Web page you need to log in to your i6 account. Here is the information necessary to log in to your account.</p>

<p>Hostname: i6.cims.nyu.edu</p>

<p>Login: <em>Your NYU NetID</em></p>

<p>Password: <em>The password given to you by Courant</em><br />
Your i6 account information was sent to you via email from helpdesk@cims.nyu.edu with the subject, “Welcome to Courant.” If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to this page for instructions on how to do so.</p>

<p>Web directory: public_html<br />
This is the folder on i6 accounts that will serve files to the Web. All HTML and image files should be uploaded into this folder (or its subdirectories) to be viewed on the Web. Do not delete public_html.</p>

<p>Web page address (URL): i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="accessing-i6-from-the-command-line">Accessing i6 from the Command Line</h3>
<p><strong>Mac and Linux Computers</strong><br />
Mac and Linux users can use Terminal to access i6 from the command line. Terminal is available in macOS via Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.</p>

<p>At the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> prompt, type in the following—substituting netid with your NetID—and press Enter.<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh netid@i6.cims.nyu.edu</code></p>

<p><strong>Windows Computers</strong><br />
PC users can download and use <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a>, an SSH and telnet client, to access i6.</p>

<p>Type in the name of the host which, in our case, is i6.cims.nyu.edu; select “SSH” and click “Open.” For reference, <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall23/CSCI-UA.0004-004/assignments/unix/putty-i6.gif">here is a screenshot</a> of a PuTTY Configuration window.</p>

<p><strong>Your Password</strong><br />
Next, enter your i6 password—which is case-sensitive. The cursor does not move as you type your password, but when you press Enter you should be logged in.</p>

<p>Once logged in, you can change your password by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passwd</code> at the prompt and following the instructions. Basic Unix commands are listed <a href="http://localhost:4999/CSCI-UA.004-Fall23/resources/unix.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems logging into your i6 account, speak with your instructor as soon as possible.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="writing-your-web-page">Writing Your Web Page</h3>
<p>Next, you need to write your page with a plain text editor. Use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, or <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> to create a new plain text document. Type the HTML code below into the document. Then enter your name inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;title&gt;</code> tag and a short self introduction inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Your name goes here&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Introduction to Web Design&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your self introduction goes here&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Raster Graphics&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Vector Graphics&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Page Layout&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Responsive Design&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Final Project&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save this file as “index.html” on your computer. View the page locally in a web browser (File &gt; Open File) to make sure it looks as it should. This page will serve as a directory for all future assignments.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="publishing-your-web-page">Publishing Your Web Page</h3>
<p>Next, you will use an SFTP client to transfer your “index.html” file from your computer to the i6 server.</p>

<p><a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a> is a free and open-source SFTP client for Mac and Windows. Alternatives include <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> and <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software.html">Fetch</a> for Mac, <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a> for Windows, and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> for Mac, Windows, and Linux. Whatever program you use, be sure to connect to i6 using SFTP (as opposed to FTP).</p>

<p>Here is an example of an FTP client’s login screen. Fill it in as follows but with your own NetID and i6 password and connect using “SFTP.” After logging in, you can upload files to the web server and also download files from the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall23/CSCI-UA.0004-004/assignments/unix/sftp-login.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Upload the index.html file from your computer to the public_html folder of your i6 account. Once you have uploaded the file, check to make sure your Web page is visible at: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="setting-permissions">Setting Permissions</h3>
<p>If your page is not visible when you try to access it at i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid and you get a 403 (Forbidden) error, you may need to change who can access your site by setting its “permissions.”</p>

<p>Log into i6 with Terminal or PuTTY and type the following commands in this order at the Unix system prompt (represented here by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> sign). Be sure to type commands exactly as they are written and do not include the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd
$ chmod 755 public_html
$ cd public_html
$ chmod 644 index.html
$ cd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your page should now be accessible to you and the world.</p>

<div class="section-break"><br /></div>

<h3 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting Your Assignment</h3>
<p>Submit the following via NYU Brightspace:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The URL to your page in the general form of i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/</li>

</ul>

<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
